#Letterman Project

Letterman is a pathfinding algorithm that finds ways to transform words into other words given an input dictionary.
Letterman may be able to find paths from cat into ramp, or dread into trampoline given enough connecting words.
Written in 100% Java code.

Searching and properly finding paths works great.

Backtracking is currently not working. Finds the solution but has no good way of relaying the path to the user.
